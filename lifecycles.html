    <h1>React State & Lifecyles</h1>
    
    <p>State and lifecycles are important concepts in the React library.</p>
    <p>This page will breifly explain the concepts and have an interactive demo along with a code snipet for them.</p>

    <p>
        In React, we have components which can be anything like a textbox, button or a graph visual. 
        Components can be stateful by having a JavaScript object called <code>state</code>. 
        <dfn>This state object stores dynamic data and determines the behavior of the component.</dfn> 
        State is private to the component and what that means is that it can only be controlled by
        the component itself. Another important detail about state is that it is <bold>immutable.</bold>
    </p>

    <h3>State Code Example 1</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
            class Greeting extends React.Component {
                constructor(props) {
                 super(props);
                   // Define your state object here
                   this.state = {
                     name: ‘Jane Doe’
                   }
                 }
                 render(){
                   return &lt;h1&gt; Hello { this.state.name } &lt;\h1&gt;;
                 }
              }
        </code>
    </pre>
