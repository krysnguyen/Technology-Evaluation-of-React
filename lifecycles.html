    <h1>React State & Lifecyles</h1>
    
    <p>State and lifecycles are important concepts in the React library.</p>
    <p>This page will breifly explain the concepts and have an interactive demo along with a code snipet for them.</p>

    <p>
        In React, we have components which can be anything like a textbox, button or a graph visual.<br> 
        Components can be stateful by having a JavaScript object called <code>state</code>.<br>
        <dfn>This state object stores dynamic data and determines the behavior of the component.</dfn><br>
        State is private to the component and what that means is that it can only be controlled by<br>
        the component itself. Another important detail about state is that it is <bold>immutable.</bold><br>
    </p>

    <h3>State Code Example 1</h3>
    <div id="code_1"></div>
    <h3>Try me:</h3>
    <br>
    <div id="state_demo"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Example 1 is a simple <code>Counter</code> component which has two buttons that increment or decrement the counter value.<br>
      We modify that value using state. We initialize the state in the constructor as well has define the methods <code>increment</code><br>
      and <code>decrement</code>. The methods will get the current state, add/subtract 1 then <code>setState</code> to set the new state.<br>
      Notice how we can't directly change the state by doing <code>this.state.counter = this.state.counter - 1</code>.<br>
      That is because state is an immutable object. 
    </p>
