##Virtual DOM demo notes:
HTML/CSS template from: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp
(All JavaScript and some of the HTML/CSS are original.) 

##Other stuff (remove later)

To run locally you'll probably need to set up a local testing server, it's really easy though:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server

Alternatively, if you're using the Brackets text editor, its live preview function automatically sets up a local testing server so you shouldn't need to do anything else. 


Feel free to take a look at the code I wrote for an example of copying existing HTML into JSX and then manipulating it with React.
